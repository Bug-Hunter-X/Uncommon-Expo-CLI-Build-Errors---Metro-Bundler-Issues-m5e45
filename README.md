# Uncommon Expo CLI Build Errors and Metro Bundler Issues

This repository demonstrates a scenario involving uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI with the Metro bundler.  These errors often manifest as seemingly random build failures, unusually slow compilation times, or unexpected app crashes,  making diagnosis challenging.

The `metroConfigBug.js` file contains a setup that could potentially trigger such issues, while `metroConfigSolution.js` provides the solution.

## Problem

Metro Bundler errors are generally hard to diagnose, especially when no direct error message points to the root cause. These might stem from configuration mistakes in `metro.config.js` or conflicting dependencies.

## Solution

Proper configuration of the Metro bundler, often involving careful review of the `metro.config.js` settings and managing dependencies, is crucial. The solution might involve adjusting transformer settings, resolving dependency conflicts, or cleaning the project's cache.
