This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage a React Native project and involves issues with the Metro bundler, which handles JavaScript code compilation and packaging for the app.  The error message might not pinpoint the exact problem, making it hard to debug.  It can manifest in various ways, like build failures, slow compilation speeds or unexplained crashes. Sometimes, it's related to incorrect configurations in `metro.config.js` or package dependencies causing conflicts.
