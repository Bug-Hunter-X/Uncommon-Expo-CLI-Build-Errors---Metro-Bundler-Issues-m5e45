The solution often involves a combination of strategies:

1. **Check `metro.config.js`:** Review the `transformer` options and ensure compatibility with your project's setup. Incorrect settings here are a common source of cryptic Metro bundler errors.
2. **Clean project cache:** Sometimes, cached data can cause unexpected issues.  Try running `expo start --clear` or clearing the cache manually.
3. **Examine Dependencies:** Carefully look at your `package.json` for any conflicting or outdated packages.  Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure everything is updated and compatible.  Consider running `npm dedupe` or `yarn dedupe` to flatten your dependency tree.
4. **Check for circular dependencies:**  These can cause unexpected issues in build processes.  Use a linter or tool to detect these.
5. **Review your code for errors:** Thoroughly examine your code for obvious syntax errors, especially in components or modules that might be involved in the error.  Linting your code will assist you in finding those.
6. **Restart your machine:** Sometimes the most simple solutions are the best.  Restarting your computer can resolve temporary issues.
